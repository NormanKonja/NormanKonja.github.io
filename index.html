                  <h2>About Me</h2>
                  <p>
                     Hi! I'm Norman Konja. I am a computer programmer who specializes in 
                     JavaScript, and Python. I've been programming for about 10 years now.
                     I feel like I was chosen to do this for a living simply by the way 
                     I was introduced to coding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The first time I ever laid eyes on computer code I was 14 years old. 
                     It all started when I was playing a wildly popular game on xbox live,
                     Call of Duty MW2. I randomly joined a hacked online game that automatically 
                     unlocked everything in the game for you upon joining it. I was intrigued by
                     the hacks I was witnessing and wanted to do them myself. So I got to work, 
                     absorbing all the information I could find on hacking the game. I eventually
                     found that I could create my own hacks through coding in C++ on a file type 
                     called a fast file in an IDE called FFviewer. I taught myself C++ through 
                     online documentation and within a few days I had my own custom hacks. 
                     One of my custom codes lets you shoot a stealth bomber plane out of your gun, have it
                     do a 360 in midair and explode with special FX. I used my codes to create an income by
                     selling an invite to my games for $10 per person on gaming forum websites. I was 14 years old
                     making $2000 a month selling hacks on a video game. This is what gave me the drive to
                     continue coding for a living, being able to create something out of nothing but a vision.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The reason why I love coding is because I feel like it has a lot of similarities to life
                     in general. You start off with a goal and you make plans to achieve your goal. Along the
                     way to the achievement of your goal you will make mistakes and errors that will need to be
                     taken into account and adjusted to continue further incremental development into the end goal.
                     It takes a strong person to be a computer programmer because it requires constant change and 
                     true effort to continue learning and getting better every day. This is the challenging part of 
                     coding that I love. There's no better feeling in life or in coding than achieving a goal, espcially 
                     when you get to learn from your experiences on the road to achievement!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     My interests outside of coding include music, books, cryptocurrency, Jiu Jitsu, investing, learning
                     , and I have an absolute passion for the stock market. I love gaining knowledge and continuously 
                     growing in all areas of life. I am a very dedicated person, with a lot of resilience  
                     that comes from a will to win and I plan on bringing that same energy with me to whatever organization I end up with!

                  This python project was built to use bittrex for trading bitcoin and other crypcurrencies from your desktop without having
                  to sign in or even look at an exchange just buy and sell directly from your python commands.
                  It's a simple and seamless way to make extremely fast trade execution.

                  This is a repository of games that I made at my previous job with Voces Digital. These games were meant to help children learn new languages.
                  Since I'm not allowed to post the completed files for the games (for obvious reasons) I posted the files with the main logic and the foundation
                  of the games right before I fully completed them for publishing. Feel free to skim through the codes to get an idea of my coding style and capabilities.
                  I have also included a link to a live 2 player card matching game that was scrapped.
